# Shortest Path Algorithm Project

Welcome to our project focused on implementing Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to calculate the shortest path between selected nodes within a graph.

## Overview
This project was conceived and developed collaboratively with the aim of providing a sophisticated solution for precise shortest path calculations. Here are some highlights:

- **Tools & Technologies:** We utilized a stack of technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intricate and feature-packed application.
- **Detailed Information:** Users are provided with detailed distance information for each path, enabling informed decision-making.
- **Visual Representation:** We integrated a visually captivating representation of paths, employing a spectrum of colors to enhance comprehension and user engagement.
- **Practical Application:** This project serves as a testament to the practical application of graph theory and emerges as a valuable solution for optimizing routes in diverse scenarios.
